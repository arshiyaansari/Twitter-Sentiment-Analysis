# Twitter Sentiment Analysis for Cigarette Sentiment 

### RamHacks 2018: Multiple Sponsor Category Winner (First Place), Honorable Mention Overall

As electronic cigarettes become more and more popular, espeically among the younger generation, it is important to understand how this trend may be affecting normal cigarette sentiment. We hypothesized that more consumers would have positive sentiments for electronic cigarettes such as juuls, but negative sentiments for regular cigarettes even though the effects of both are equally bad on one's health. We hope to understand how users who may have started on electronic cigarettes have migrated to normal cigarettes due to pricing and accessibility.
